		    <ol>
		       <li><h3 class="heading"><em>The way you see yourself(Perceptual)</em></h3>
			   <p> The way you see your body is not always a correct representation of what you
				actually look like. For example, a person may perceive themselves to be fat when
				in reality they are underweight. How a person sees themselves is their perceptual
				body image.</p> </li> 
		   
		       <li><h3 class="heading"><em>The way you feel about the way you look (Affective)</em></h3>
		       <p>There are things a person may like or dislike about the way they look. Your feelings
				about your body, especially the amount of satisfaction or dissatisfaction you
				experience in relation to your appearance, weight, shape and body parts is your
				affective body image. </p></li> 
		   
		       <li><h3 class="heading"><em>The thoughts and beliefs you feel about your body (Cognitive)</em></h3>
		       <p>Some people believe that they will feel better about themselves if they are thinner.
				Others believe they will look better if they develop more muscle. The way you
				think about your body is your cognitive body image. </p></li> 

		        <li><h3 class="heading"><em>The things you do in relation to the way you look (Behavioural)</em></h3>
		       <p>When a person is dissatisfied with the way they look, they may employ destructive
				behaviours such as excessive exercising or disordered eating as a means to
				change appearance. Some people may isolate themselves because they feel bad
				about the way they look. Behaviours in which you engage as a result of your body
				image encompasses your behavioural body image.</p></li>
