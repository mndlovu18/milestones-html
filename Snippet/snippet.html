			<h1>The Anatomy of an HTML Tag</h1>

		    <p>In this section I am going to breakdown a snippet of code into the various components that make it up and explain what each part does and how the different parts relate to each other.</p>

			   <h2> TAGS</h2>
			   <p> Tags are created by the use of less-than and greater-than angle brackets around an element.Tags occur in pairs of opening and closing tags. In the above we are going to identify the opening and closing tags</p>
			   
			   <h3>Opening Tags</h3>
			   <p>An opening tag marks the beginning of an element. It starts with a less-than sign followed by an element’s name, and then ends with a greater-than sign.  <br>
			     
			   </p>
			   <h3>Closing Tags</h3>
			   <p>A closing tag marks the end of an element. It starts with a less-than sign followed by a forward slush, an element’s name, and then ends with a greater-than sign.  <br>
			     
			   </p>
			   
			   <h3>Code Snippet Explained</h3>
			   <p> The code snippet has parent tag with an element name <span style="color: pink"> p </span> that represents a paragraph. The tag with an element name <span style="color: pink"> a </span> is a child of the parent tag and is found nested inside the paragrapgh tag. Both tags have an opening and closing tag. The child tag has an attribute <span style="color: hotpink"> href</span> that provides more information about the element. This particular attribute provides a hyperlink reference to a linked source.</p>
